# Topic 2 (english version + french version)

You are on the **EN** version generated from the file `topic2/index.en.md`.

This page will also be used in the **FR** version since no `topic2/index.fr.md` file is present and that the default language is `en`.

```

Use the **language switcher in the header** to switch between the localized
versions of the website. This switcher is part of [mkdocs-material >= 7.1.0](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-language/#site-language-selector) and is configured from the [mkdocs.yml file](https://github.com/ultrabug/mkdocs-static-i18n/blob/main/mkdocs.yml).
